# euler_equations_FV_scheme

For use with Python >= 3.6.
To run main.py or advection_test.py in terminal, do "ipython main.py" with no inputs.
Each routine returns an animation, given the parameters inside the relevant code.
solvers.py is a class containing the routines for the FV scheme that are called in the other driver codes.
In this case the FV scheme is the HLLE approximate Riemann solver.
